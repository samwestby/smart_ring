# smart_ring
This project is code for a smart ring that accepts different gestures. When an appropriate gesture is performed, it sends a bluetooth signal to an app, where the app can play/pause music and also change the volume.


Arduino code is based off the Krodal Arduino MPU-6050 code and [this](https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-AND-Bluetooth-HC-05-Connecting-easily/) HC-05 arduino example

Android app is based off [Mayoogh/Arduino-Bluetooth-Basic](https://github.com/Mayoogh/Arduino-Bluetooth-Basic)

[Here's my YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svmqA4YMEq8) demonstrating the smart ring
